# WT-Linux-Build-2020
For Building Linux laptops (ubuntu) and hardening to CIS standards
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to aid with the build of ubuntu based machines.
I have tried to make this as user friendly as possible, hence the menu options for example, if you needed to just join the machine to the domain, you have that option.
### This is very much a work in progress and should be treated as such. 
## How to run
1) Clone this Git repo to a file on the local machine
2) Make shell scripts executable 
3) Launch the run.sh file to bring up the diaglog / option menu
